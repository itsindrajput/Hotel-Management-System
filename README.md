### (HMS) - Java with Hibernate

Welcome to our Hotel Management System project! 🎉 Building a Hotel Management System (HMS) in Java using Hibernate for CRUD operations is an excellent project for honing your skills in both Java programming and Hibernate ORM.

I'll guide you through the process step by step. Let's begin by crafting a well-structured Main class that serves as the entry point to our application. Additionally, this approach facilitates easy integration of more advanced features and functionalities as our Hotel Management System evolves.

### Setup Instructions 🚀

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone <git@github.com:itsindrajput/Hotel-Management-System.git>
   ```

2. **IDE Setup:**

   - Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

3. **Database Configuration:**

   - Choose a database management system (DBMS) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or H2.
   - Configure the database connection details in `hibernate.cfg.xml`.

4. **Dependency Management:**
   - Ensure Maven is installed.
   - Run Maven to resolve dependencies:
     ```
     mvn clean install
     ```

### Usage Instructions 📘

1. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the application from your IDE.
2. **Interacting with the System:**
   - Use the provided CRUD operations to manage rooms, guests, reservations, and invoices.

### Folder Structure 📚

```
src/main/java
└── org

        │   └── ReservationService.java
        └── App.java

```

### Dependencies 🚗

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies for Hibernate in your project. You'll typically need hibernate-core and the JDBC driver for your database. Make sure to include these dependencies in your pom.xml if you're using Maven for dependency management.
